# cough-analyzer-Covid
This repository implements a supervised COVID-19 detection system based on cough audio recordings using machine learning techniques. The project applies classification models trained on audio data to identify acoustic patterns associated with potential COVID-19 cases, aiming to support early and non-invasive diagnosis.
